Last day in Ithaca. Hard to emotionally reach out and grasp the fact it's all come to an end. Took a free desk on the side of Buffalo St. with Munson and move it out onto the porch. Many clutch ducks will one day occupy it. Going to NYC with Myra on a bus this afternoon. Anticipation re: a new life and seeing Emily prevail. I've read a lot online about how NYC apartment hunting is akin to being raped. I hope not to get raped. Many promising leads but many foreign brokers. Said good-bye to Dawn Lee last night: emotional. I have a letter from her I'll read on the bus. The bus must also consist of runs through `An Awesome Wave' and Two Door Cinema Club's `Tourist History'. Turns out Anna can give gifts: a `Hey Brother' Mug and a Bear that holds deodorant. 

Can you imagine if Myra had a black T-shirt with `\emph{Big Dicks Only}' brazen across the chest in big white letters?
